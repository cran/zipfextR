# zipfextR

Implementation of four extensions of the Zipf distribution: the Marshall-Olkin Extended Zipf (MOEZipf) PÃ©rez-Casany, M., & Casellas, A. (2013) <arXiv:1304.4540>, the Zipf-Poisson Extreme (Zipf-PE), the Zipf-Poisson Stopped Sum (Zipf-PSS) distributions and the Zipf-Polylog. In log-log scale, the two first extensions allow for top-concavity and top-convexity while the third one only allows for top-concavity. All the extensions maintain the linearity associated with the Zipf model in the tail.
